## WHAT IS BUTTON MASH?

Button Mash is a not-for-profit community group located in Belfast, Northern Ireland, that brings together people from across the island of Ireland and farther afield, to nurture local home-grown talent and challenge each other across all kinds of fighting games, as well as providing a valuable community and social space for people to come out from behind their screens and meet each other in-person.

## WHO IS BUTTON MASH?

Button Mash is a group of fighting game players who came together in Northern Ireland to create both in-person and digital spaces in which the local community could learn, train and grow from each other to compete in international tournaments. The group was founded in 2019 by a collection of players who were growing frustrated with the limitations of online play and the lack of expertise among current tournament offerings available in Northern Ireland. With strong links in particular to the Dublin fighting game community, Button Mash is Northern Ireland’s strongest and largest fighting game hub.

## WHERE DOES BUTTON MASH TAKE PLACE?

Button Mash has seen a variety of homes since its fruition. Currently, we find ourselves upstairs in The American Bar thanks to a gracious offering by the bar owner Pedro Donald, but previously we have been located across Belfast including The Sunflower, The Black Box and The Rainbow Project. During the height of the covid pandemic, Button Mash moved online and hosted various tournament offerings including their popular ISOLATION series which received record numbers from professional international talent. We wish to continue occupying both physical and digital spaces, and improve our capacity for our livestream offerings.

## WHEN DOES BUTTON MASH TAKE PLACE?

Button Mash meets as a community group once on the last Sunday of every month, and then will feature a larger tournament offering quarterly. We’re hoping to expand this to being a weekly community gathering. The tournaments normally last from 12pm to around 6pm, although set up times before and tournament times after can push this time depending on the number of entrants.

## HOW AND WHY DOES BUTTON MASH EXIST?

Button Mash was born from a frustration at the community offerings that fighting games has across Northern Ireland. There are few opportunities outside of university spaces for players to gather and meet socially with each other to share information, and within those institutions there are limitations, both time and money wise, as to what can be achieved and what the community can grow into. Northern Ireland also boasts a particularly tight knit community with many strong players, but there was little in the form of organising or formalising the group until players decided to form Button Mash out of community need.

## WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT BUTTON MASH CURRENTLY FACES?

The biggest challenge that Button Mash currently faces is surrounding it’s venue space. Pedro from The American Bar has given us in-kind support use of the upstairs in the bar space, but this presents several issues for us as a community group. Firstly, there is no disabled access to the upstairs portion, which has already meant that several of our disabled community have either had to struggle up the flights of stairs with help from other players, or worse not attend at all. The upstairs also has a significant mould problem which puts the health of our players at risk. What’s more, is that the venue’s internet is currently not able to host our live streaming capabilities, which limits our reach to our community members who aren’t able to make the in-person meetings, our wider European network of players and limits our marketing opportunities in the digital space to grow our tournament. The space also is very small, meaning we must limit the amount of tournaments and players we host at any given time.

Another challenge is surrounding our staffing requirements. Per offline session, Button Mash takes roughly 30 hours of work split between multiple specialists to stage, including Tournament Organisers, Finance and Administration, Graphic Designers, Social Media Managers, Stream and Tech Management, and more, and this is currently done by members of the community for free out of a genuine love and passion for the group. Ideally, we would like to be able to pay these community members for their specialist knowledge and time involved in creating the sessions so that they can dedicate their resources to the tournament.

Our final challenge is about the tournament’s tech requirements. The nature of the games that we play means there are constantly new games, consoles, downloadable content and updates being released that means in order to keep up with the current state of the games, there needs to be continued investment from the community into the technology available in order to host the tournaments.
